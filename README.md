Data source: [Brazil Kidney Waitlist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gustavomodelli/waitlist-kidney-brazil) from Kaggle

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that is capable of predicting whether or not a new patient added to a kidney transplant waitlist will receive a kidney from a deceased donor. This is a binary classification problem.
