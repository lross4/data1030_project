cPRA: Very important criteria by which doctors select patients for transplants. cPRA stands for calculated panel-reactive antibody, and it measures a patient's sensitivity to HLA antigens and the incompatibility of donated organs. A higher value indicates a higher likelihood that an introduced kidney will be rejected by your body. (Numerical feature)

cPRA_cat: Identifies categories within which the patient's cPRA value falls.

    From50To80
    Over80
    
The 9 following features are related to a person's Human Leukocyte Antigen matching scores. These are important criteria for the allocation of kidney transplants. A person's HLA DR score has the highest weight in terms of allocation criteria, followed by HLA B and HLA A.

    HLA_A2: Human Leukocyte Antigen A1 score
    HLA_B1: Human Leukocyte Antigen B1 score

        heterozygous
        homozygous
